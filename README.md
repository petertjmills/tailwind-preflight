# Tailwind Preflight

Tailwind's alternative to [`Reset.css`](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)/[`normalize.css`](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)/[`modern-normalize.css`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize)

It is very good, and I am used to all of the styles being like this when I make websites :)
